### 🔍 Profile Summary
Currently, I am expanding my technical horizons through an **MS in Data Science at the University of Maryland**. My professional foundation was built as an **Associate Data Engineer at Shell**, where I developed a passion for the intricate process of transforming raw, complex data into meaningful insights.

I find the most fulfillment in the "build and break" phase of a project—experimenting with new frameworks, refining data pipelines, and finding creative solutions to technical roadblocks. For me, data science is as much about curiosity and persistence as it is about the code itself.
