# Hi, I’m Shreevatsa 👋

I like working with data from the moment it’s messy to the point where it starts answering real questions.
I enjoy understanding *what the data is really saying*,how it was generated, and how to turn it into systems
and models that are both useful and trustworthy.
I learn best by building things end-to-end from raw data and pipelines to analysis and insights.

### 🧠 What I’m curious about
• Exploring patterns and signals in real-world data  
• Building data pipelines that support meaningful analysis  
• Using data science to inform decisions, not just dashboards  
• Applying ML thoughtfully, not blindly  

---

### 🔬 How I like to work with data
• Start close to the source and question assumptions  
• Spend time understanding distributions and edge cases  
• Prefer simple, interpretable models when possible  
• Care about reproducibility and clean data workflows  

---

### 🛠 Tools I reach for
• **Languages:** Python, SQL  
• **Data & ML:** Pandas, PySpark, Spark ML  
• **Orchestration:** Airflow  
• **Platforms:** Databricks  
• **Cloud:** AWS, Azure  
• **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Redshift  

Tools matter less than asking the right questions.

### 🌿 Outside of work
• I enjoy cooking and experimenting with flavors  
• I like long walks and thinking away from screens  
• Sustainability and conscious choices matter to me
